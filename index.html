      <h2>What Is a Travel-Focused Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>A travel-focused credit card is a standard card product with features designed around trips: foreign-currency spending, airline or hotel rewards, airport lounges and built-in travel protections. The underlying rails are the same as any other card — what changes is how fees and benefits are structured.</p>
      <p>Some travel cards aim to reduce foreign transaction fees, others prioritize reward currencies and perks. Understanding the mechanics helps you interpret marketing claims and compare cards more consistently.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Card Payments Work in Another Currency</h2>
      <p>When you pay in a foreign country, the terminal usually sends the amount in local currency through the card network. Your issuer then converts the amount to your billing currency using a network rate plus any FX margin defined in the card’s terms.</p>
      <p>Sometimes you are offered <em>dynamic currency conversion (DCC)</em>, where the merchant or their provider converts the amount to your home currency at the point of sale. This often includes an extra spread, which is why many issuers and regulators advise reading the on-screen rate carefully before accepting.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>FX Fees, Margins and ATM Withdrawals</h2>
      <p>Travel cards can differ significantly in how they handle foreign spending. Key variables include a percentage FX fee, any minimum charge per transaction and how competitive the underlying exchange rate is.</p>
      <p>ATM withdrawals are often treated separately, with their own fee structure and interest rules. Even “no FX fee” cards may apply extra costs to cash withdrawals, so it is worth checking the dedicated cash-advance section of the documentation.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Travel Rewards, Lounges and Partner Ecosystems</h2>
      <p>Many travel cards earn points or miles in an airline or hotel program, or in a flexible bank currency that can be transferred to partners. Some products include lounge access, fast track or status boosts as part of the package.</p>
      <p>Reward structures are highly program-specific. Earning rates, partner charts and devaluations over time all influence the real value of each point or mile, independently of the card’s annual fee or headline bonus.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Travel Protections and Limitations</h2>
      <p>Cards may include travel insurance, delay and cancellation coverage, baggage protections and rental-car benefits. These protections are governed by detailed policy documents with specific eligibility criteria, excess amounts and exclusions.</p>
      <p>Whether you need separate travel insurance depends on your risk tolerance and local regulations. This site does not recommend products; it simply highlights that coverage via cards is often conditional on using the card to pay for the trip.</p>
